title: "Blog Post 3"
description: |
  This blog post differs to the first two as it is a self-reflection focusing on a previously constructed shiny application, the purpose of which was to explore COVID-19 related data in the United States of America (USA). Rather than analysing the findings made possible by the app, a self-review of the analysis process will be undertaken focusing on four key questions.
